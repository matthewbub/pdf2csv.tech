Tomorrow I want to 
- [x] finish the editable state in the import flow (Just do "Edit All")
- create a view for viewing the data (essentially the BankStatementDetailsTable)
- create a system for tracking how many pages a user has uploaded
- create the billing system with Stripe (Details in Notion)
- deploy!
- fix bank statement draw should protect data ( I think there's a greater bug that will be uncovered here. The Go endpoint that gets the page count should really be splittling the PDF and sending back indiviudal pages so we can work with the individual PDF page from there. This will be a big weight of the async request we send for each page to get the preview; becuase right now we're just sending the full request)
