This is a document that covers alot of ground in our internal authentication system. This is a good point of refernce if you are someone who is needing to work in this functional area. We tend to keep it locked down so this is probably the most your going to see on it. We'll try to be comprehensive.

What you can expect to see in this service is a comprehensive jwt based authentication system. This service is hosted directly on cloudflare.
