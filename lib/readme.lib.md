Hey the lib directory is a collection of applications and assets that fall outside the scope of the go server.

Arch TODOs

- [ ] `/cmd` -> move to application source code as a start process
- [ ] `/routes` -> move to `lib/application`
- [ ] `/scripts` -> move to `lib/scripts` (CAREFUL WITH RELATIVE PATHS)
