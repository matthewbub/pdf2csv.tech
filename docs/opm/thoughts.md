Tracking token usage and can see that images are going to be the largest drawl of tokens. averaging 25-30k for prompts and under 100 for completion (aka this is expensive and probably not a sustainable business)

Working with a headless browser (puppeter) is such a fucking easy way to test ui behaviors. I'm thinking about launching a python server via api endpoint, maybe it should be something else like above the server, i just want it to be synonymous with the server

Gave up on this project and went off to do other things but now im back. Having a surprising amount of fun working in the app after being away for a bit and am actually banging out some real features so that's nice
